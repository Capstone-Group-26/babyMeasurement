# Baby Body Measurement using Computer Vision

## Prerequisites

- Hardware: **iPhone 6s and later**, all iPad Pro models, iPad 5th generation and later
- MacOS with Xcode 11 or later installed

The app was designed specifically for the iPhone.
While technically it can run on an iPad, the user interface may not adapt well to the bigger screen.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open Xcode
3. When opening the project, do not do it by selecting the directory.
Instead, go inside the directory and select the workspace.
This ensures a third-party dependency is correctly imported.
4. Before you can compile and install the app onto an iPhone, you have to sign the app with a valid Apple ID.
5. Compile and install the app by clicking on the "Run" button.
6. Once installed, you will also need to permit the app to run on your iPhone.
Go to Settings > Device Management > Trust this developer.
7. Rerun the app from Xcode
